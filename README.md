# Markdown YAML front-matter to JSON

`m2j.js` is used to read a folder of Markdown files, pulling out the YAML front matter from each, and saving it all as a JSON object.

In addition to moving the YAML to JSON, a few extra elements are created: 

-  `iso8601` [formatted][1] from `date` using [Moment.js][2]
-  `preview` is first 70 or so characters of the actual raw markdown content, with ellipses at the end
-  `basename` is the filename without the path or extension

_Example_

```
% m2.js --help

Usage: m2j.js [options] <files>

Options:

  -h, --help        output usage information
  -V, --version     output the version number
  -w --width <int>  max width of preview text [70]
    
% m2j.js lottery.ms
```
